While raised, this steel shield (Hardness 8, HP 32, BT 16) grants its circumstance bonus to Reflex saves against area effects (as well as to AC, as normal).\n\nWhile you hold the shield, it also grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Will saves against a dragon's frightful presence ability. The shield has resistance 10 against the damage type corresponding to the type of dragon whose hide was used in its creation; this applies after reducing the damage for Hardness, so when you use Shield Block, the dragonslayer's shield takes 18 less damage from attacks of that damage type. You can use Shield Block against attacks that deal damage of that type.\n\n**Dragon's Breath Potion**\n\n**Dragon Type** | **Breath Weapon (Save)**\n--- | ---\nBlack or copper | 30-foot line of acid (Reflex)\nBlue or bronze | 30-foot line of electricity (Reflex)\nBrass | 30-foot line of fire (Reflex)\nGreen | 15-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)\nGold or red | 15-foot cone of fire (Reflex)\nSilver or white | 15-foot cone of cold (Reflex)"

    "body": "When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves. You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example, if you're hit by an effect that inflicts drained 3 and you're a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit Points doesn't count as taking damage.\n\nEach time you get a full night's rest, your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don't immediately recover the lost Hit Points."
